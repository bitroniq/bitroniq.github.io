      <b>Why choose Jekyll:</b><br>
      <b>Simplicity:</b> Use Markdown or CMS of your choice.<br>
      <b>Speed:</b> Pages are pre-rendered html pages, so no backend needed for every request.<br>
      <b>Secure:</b> While only html pages make you site loads really fast, there is no backend coded to hack!</p>
