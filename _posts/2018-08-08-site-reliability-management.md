As a big fan of Trello and their approach for making life easier with their Boards, recently I discovered that they have a lot of [inspiring Boards](https://trello.com/inspiringboards).

> A collection of boards to inspire new and creative uses of Trello in both your personal and work life. All of these boards can be copied and used as a jumping off point for projects of your own.
> For instructions on how to copy a board please [check](http://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards)

## Example Board for Site Reliability

One of them is a board example created to manage and maintain systems-related improvements, architecture, and development. So all the tasks related with Site Reliability.

So if you are looking for inspiration and a board for your team to:
* Establish long-term goals and priorities required to maintain site reliability.
* Track incoming issues that need immediate attention and delegate tasks to team members.
* In a glance, see what has been tested, merged, and deployed into production.
* Connect Jira and Bitbucket to easily access the issue or pull request relevant to each card.

## Check the Board and copy to your Trello

Open the Trello Board and check how it is organized. There is a description of the workflow in the first column, so your team will know how to interact.

If the links is not working I made a mirror of that board on my public Trello.
